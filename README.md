# Keyser

I've been using AI to review Keyser, WV's ordiances - quick sifts leading to detailed research into what is just and unjust. 

The deeper I go, the more I see this being a huge benefit in upgrading or otherwise improving local laws.

I've created this repository on the subject for the public to keep track of my doings, and for anyone else to chime in via pull requests. Fork it, baby!
