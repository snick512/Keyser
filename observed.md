### **Authority to Punish Disorderly Persons**

> The City may “restrain and punish vagrants, mendicants, beggars, tramps, common prostitutes, and their associates and drunken or disorderly persons within the municipality...”  
> **Source:** Charter §16

⚠️ **Note:** This language is outdated and likely **unenforceable as written** due to modern constitutional standards (e.g., *[Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville]([Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville | 405 U.S. 156 (1972) | Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/156/))*, 1972).
